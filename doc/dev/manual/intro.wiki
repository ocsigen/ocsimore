This project is not maintained anymore.

Ocsimore was a content management system written using Eliom. It was under development (not usable for now without a lot of work). It contains a wiki, and a news/forums/blog system. More documentation will be available later. Ocsimore is now used on ocsigen.org and [[http://www.pps.jussieu.fr]].
